\title{Read a Bruker OPUS spectrum binary raw string}
\usage{
opus_read_raw(rw, type = "spec", atm_comp_minus4offset = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rw}{a raw vector}

\item{type}{Character vector of spectra types to extract from OPUS binary
file. Default is \code{"spec"}, which will extract the final spectra, e.g.
expressed in absorbance (named \code{AB} in Bruker OPUS programs). Possible
additional values for the character vector supplied to \code{type} are \code{"spec_no_atm_comp"} (spectrum of the sample without compensation for atmospheric gases, water vapor and/or carbon dioxide),
\code{"sc_sample"} (single channel spectrum of the sample measurement),
\code{"sc_ref"} (single channel spectrum of the reference measurement),
\code{"ig_sample"} (interferogram of the sample measurement) and \code{"ig_ref"}
(interferogram of the reference measurement).}

\item{atm_comp_minus4offset}{Logical whether spectra after atmospheric
compensation are read with an offset of -4 bytes from Bruker OPUS
files. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a list of 10 elements:
- \code{metadata}: a \code{data.frame} containing metadata from the OPUS file
- \code{spec} If \code{"spec"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{spec_no_atm_comp} If \code{"spec_no_atm_comp"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample without atmospheric compensation (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{sc_sample} If \code{"sc_sample"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{sc_ref} If \code{"sc_ref"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{ig_sample} If \code{"ig_sample"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the interferogram of the sample (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{ig_ref}  If \code{"ig_ref"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a matrix of the interferogram of the reference (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{wavenumbers} If \code{"spec"} or \code{"spec_no_atm_comp"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{wavenumbers_sc_sample} If \code{"sc_sample"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).
- \code{wavenumbers_sc_ref} If \code{"sc_ref"} was requested in the \code{type} option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to \code{NULL}).

\description{
Read single binary acquired with an
Bruker Vertex FTIR Instrument
}
\details{
The type of spectra returned by the function when using \code{type = "spec"} depends on the setting of the Bruker instrument: typically, it can be either absorbance or reflectance.

The type of spectra to extract from the file can also use Bruker's OPUS software naming conventions, as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{ScSm} corresponds to \code{sc_sample}
\item \code{ScRf} corresponds to \code{sc_ref}
\item \code{IgSm} corresponds to \code{ig_sample}
\item \code{IgRf} corresponds to \code{ig_ref}
}
